## What is Minet?

Minet is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software written in C#. Current goal is to create a server that has enterprise performance for large Minecraft multi-user gaming providers. Current servers handle 10-100 users per instance, the aim with MiNET is to deal with thousands. Priority is also to create interfaces, and to some extend, ready-made implementations of the most basic enterprise game-management features (users, worlds, etc.). This project is still in early development stage.


## Can I do my own plugins?
